    PS C:\> New-PSUSchedule -Script $Script -Cron '*/5 * * * *'
    
    Creates a new schedule that runs every five minutes.
    -------------------------- Example 2 --------------------------
    
    PS C:\> $Password = Get-UAVariable -Name 'password'
    PS C:\> $Credential = New-UACredential -Name 'adam' -Password $Password
    PS C:\> $Script = Get-UAScript -Name 'Script1.ps1'
    PS C:\> New-PSUSchedule -Script $Script -Cron '*/5 * * * *'
    
    Creates a new schedule that runs every five minutes as 'adam'.
    -------------------------- Example 3 --------------------------
    
    PS C:\> $Script = Get-UAScript -Name 'Script1.ps1'
    PS C:\> New-PSUSchedule -Script $Script -Continous -DelayMinute 5
