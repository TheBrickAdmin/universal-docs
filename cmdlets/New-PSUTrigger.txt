DESCRIPTION
    Creates a new Automation trigger in PowerShell Universal. Powershell Universal Automation triggers allow you to execute scripts based on events within PowerShell Universal. You can run scripts when other scripts fail, dashboards stop or when the server is starting up.
    
    Triggers are stored within the ./universal/triggers.ps1 file.
    
    You can also use this cmdlet to create triggers through the REST API.
