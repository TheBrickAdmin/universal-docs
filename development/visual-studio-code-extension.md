# Visual Studio Code Extension

PowerShell Universal can be managed with the PowerShell Universal Visual Studio Code extension. It allows you to connect to a local Universal instance and manage APIs, dashboards and scripts.

## Installation

You can download the extension from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ironmansoftware.powershell-universal). You can also download the extension from within the Visual Studio Code extension pane. Search for PowerShell Universal and click Install.

## Configuration

The extension will prompt you for the URL and App Token used to connect to your PowerShell Universal instance. Follow the instructions within the extension when it starts up.

### Configure From PowerShell Universal

You can configure the extension by navigating to your PowerShell Universal admin console and then logging in. Navigate to Settings \ Configurations and click Edit with VS Code. A new app token will be generated, and the URL will be set automatically.

The connections array can have zero to many connections. You can provide names for each connection.

    {
        "name": "Remote",
        "url": "http://localhost:5000",
        "appToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJodHRwOi8vc2NoZW1hcy54bWxzb2FwLm9yZy93cy8yMDA1LzA1L2lkZW50aXR5L2NsYWltcy9uYW1lIjoiYWRtaW4iLCJodHRwOi8vc2NoZW1hcy54bWxzb2FwLm9yZy93cy8yMDA1LzA1L2lkZW50aXR5L2NsYWltcy9oYXNoIjoiOGNiMjAxYzAtZWQxMy00M2YyLThiMjItNmY1ODkxNjRhZWM2Iiwic3ViIjoiUG93ZXJTaGVsbFVuaXZlcnNhbCIsImh0dHA6Ly9zY2hlbWFzLm1pY3Jvc29mdC5jb20vd3MvMjAwOC8wNi9pZGVudGl0eS9jbGFpbXMvcm9sZSI6IkFkbWluaXN0cmF0b3IiLCJuYmYiOjE2NDQxODMxMzIsImV4cCI6MjEwMjA5OTUyMCwiaXNzIjoiSXJvbm1hblNvZnR3YXJlIiwiYXVkIjoiUG93ZXJTaGVsbFVuaXZlcnNhbCJ9.6Y9Bgwaw8GTpRrH3Qp7TCW-UGdPm85E9NClOCyGBVA8"

## Debugging

{% hint style="info" %}
The Administrator role is required for debugging scripts remotely.
{% endhint %}

As of PowerShell Universal v4.2, you can debug scripts remotely with the PowerShell Universal extension. To enable remote debugging, you will need to set the debugger environment in the settings. This is the process that will be started and will load PowerShell Editor Services.

```powershell
Set-PSUSetting -DebuggerEnvironment 'pwsh'
```

When connected to your PowerShell Universal instance, you can expand Platform \ Processes and then locate the process you wish to debug. If you use the `Wait-Debugger` cmdlet in your scripts, they will be displayed within the process and runspace drop down. Click the Attach Runspace command to begin debugging your script.
