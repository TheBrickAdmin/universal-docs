# Jobs

Jobs are the result of running a script. Jobs are retained based on the script and server level settings.

## Viewing Jobs

Jobs can be viewed by clicking the Automation / Jobs page. Click the View button to navigate to the job. Jobs in progress can also been cancelled.

### View Job Output

Standard PowerShell streams such as information, host, error, warning and verbose are shown within the output pane.

![Standard Output](<../.gitbook/assets/image (450).png>)

### View Job Pipeline Output

{% hint style="info" %}
Storing large amounts of pipeline output can negatively affect performance. You can discard pipeline output by setting the Discard Pipeline setting on scripts.
{% endhint %}

Pipeline output for jobs is also stored within PowerShell Universal. Any object that is written to the pipeline is stored as CliXml and available for view within the Pipeline Output tab.

You can expand the tree view to see the objects and properties from the pipeline.

### Viewing Errors

Any errors written to the error stream will be available on the Error tab within the job page.

## Status

Jobs will return various statuses depending on configuration and the result of the execution. Settings that can affect job status include:

* ErrorActionPreference
* WarningActionPreference

The following table describes how PowerShell Universal treats statuses.

| Status              | Description                                         | Suppress                                        |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Error               | A script had a non-terminating error.               | Set ErrorActionPreference to SilentlyContinue   |
| Warning             | A script had a warning.                             | Set WarningActionPreference to SilentlyContinue |
| Failed              | A script had a terminating error.                   | Handle the terminating error or catch it.       |
| Waiting on Feedback | A script is waiting on feedback, such as Read-Host. | Avoid user callbacks such as read-host.         |
| Running             | The script is currently running.                    | N\A                                             |
| Queued              | The script is currently queued to run.              | N\A                                             |

## Feedback

Some jobs will require feedback. Any script that contains a `Read-Host` call will wait until there is user interaction with that job. The job will be in a Waiting for Feedback state, and you can respond to that feedback by click the Response to Feedback button on the job page.

![Waiting for Feedback](<../.gitbook/assets/image (400).png>)

To accept a `SecureString` with a password input field, you can use the `-AsSecureString` parameter of `Read-Host`.

## Invoking Jobs from PowerShell

You can use `Invoke-PSUScript` to invoke jobs from the command line. You will need a valid [App Token](../config/security/#app-tokens) to do so. Parameters are defined using dynamic parameters on the `Invoke-PSUScript` cmdlet.

```powershell
Invoke-PSUScript -Script 'Script1.ps1' -RequiredParameter 'Hello'
```

### Call Scripts from Scripts

You can also call UA scripts from UA scripts. When running a job in UA, you don't need to define an app token or the computer name manually. These will be defined for you. You can just call `Invoke-PSUScript` within your script to start another script. Both jobs will be shown in the UI. If you want to wait for the script to finish, use `Wait-PSUJob`.

### Waiting for a Script to Finished

You can use the `Wait-PSUJob` cmdlet to wait for a job to finish. Pipe the return value of `Invoke-PSUScript` to `Wait-UAJob` to wait for the job to complete. `Wait-PSUJob` will wait indefinitely unless the `-Timeout` parameter is specified.

```powershell
Invoke-PSUScript -Script 'Script1.ps1' -RequiredParameter 'Hello' | Wait-PSUJob
```

### Return Pipeline Data

You can use the `Get-PSUJobPipelineOutput` cmdlet to return the pipeline output that was produced by a job. This pipeline output will be deserialized objects that were written to the pipeline during the job. You can access this data from where you have access to the PowerShell Universal Management API.

```powershell
Get-PSUJobPipelineOutput -JobId 10
```

### Returning the last job's output

It may be required to return the output from a script's last job run. In order to do this, you will need to use a combination of cmdlets to retrieve the script, the last job's ID and then return the pipeline or host output.

```powershell
$Job = Get-PSUScript -Name 'Script.ps1' | Get-PSUJob -OrderDirection Descending -First 1
Get-PSUJobPipelineOutput -Job $Job
Get-PSUJobOutput -Job $Job
```

### Invoke a Script and Wait for Output

The following example invokes a script, stores the job object in a `$job` variable, waits for the job to complete and then returns the pipeline and host output.

```powershell
Invoke-PSUScript -Script 'Script1.ps1' -RequiredParameter 'Hello' | Tee-Object -Variable job | Wait-PSUJob

$Pipeline = Get-PSUJobPipelineOutput -Job $Job
$HostOutput = Get-PSUJobOutput -Job $Job

# Access the actual string returned by the job
# $HostOutput may be an array 
$HostOutput.Data
```

If you are using PowerShell Universal 2.4 or later, you can use the `-Wait` parameter of `Invoke-PSUScript` to achieve this.

```powershell
$Pipeline = Invoke-PSUScript -Script 'Script1.ps1' -RequiredParameter 'Hello' -Wait
```

### Integrated Mode

The integrated mode allows calling these cmdlets from within PowerShell Universal without an App Token or Computer Name. It uses the internal RPC channel to communicate.

You can set the `-Integrated` parameter to switch to integrated mode. This parameter does not work outside of PowerShell Universal.

```powershell
Invoke-PSUScript -Script 'Script.ps1' -Integrated
```

The following cmdlets support integrated mode.

* Get-PSUScript
* Invoke-PSUScript
* Get-PSUJob
* Get-PSUJobOutput
* Get-PSUJobPipelineOutput
* Get-PSUJobFeedback
* Set-PSUJobFeedback
* Wait-PSUJob

## Invoking Jobs with REST

You can call jobs over REST using the management API for PowerShell Universal. You will need a valid app token to invoke jobs.

### Call Scripts with REST

To call a script, you call an HTTP POST to the script endpoint with the ID of the script you wish to execute.

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:5000/api/v1/script/7 -Method POST -Body "" -Headers @{ Authorization = "Bearer appToken" } -ContentType 'application/json'
```

### Providing Parameters

You can provide parameters to the job via a query string. Parameters will be provided to your script as strings.

```powershell
$Parameters = @{
    Uri = "http://localhost:5000/api/v1/script/path/PNP.ps1?Server=tester&Domain=test" 
    Method = "POST"
    Headers = @{Authorization = "Bearer $Apptoken"}
    ContentType = 'application/json'
    Body = '{}'
}

Invoke-RestMethod @Parameters
```

### Setting the Environment

You can set the environment by pass in the environment property to the job context. The property must be the name of an environment defined within your PSU instance.

```powershell
$JobContext = @{
    Environment = "PowerShell 7"
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:5000/api/v1/script/7 -Method POST -Body $JobContext -Headers @{ Authorization = "Bearer appToken" } -ContentType 'application/json'
```

### Setting the Run As account

You can set the run as account by passing in the name of a PSCredential variable to the Credential property.

```powershell
$JobContext = @{
    Credential = "MyUser"
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:5000/api/v1/script/7 -Method POST -Body $JobContext -Headers @{ Authorization = "Bearer appToken" } -ContentType 'application/json'
```

## Variables Defined in Jobs

Variables defined in jobs can be found on the [variables page](../platform/variables.md#scripts).

## Job Run ID

The default behavior for PowerShell Universal is to track jobs based on an autoincrementing int64-based ID. Every time a new job is run, the job is one higher in ID than the last. Because of this behavior, it is easy to guess other job IDs and can potentially lead to a security risk.

In order to avoid this issue, you can enable the `JobRunID` experimental feature. Although internally the system still creates jobs with ascending numeric IDs, you cannot access jobs based on those IDs. Instead, a new field called `RunID` is used. `RunID` utilizes a `GUID` rather than an ID for look ups. This greatly reduces the ability for an attacker to guess a job ID.

You will need to enable this feature to use it.

```powershell
Set-PSUSetting -JobRunId
```
