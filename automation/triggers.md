# Triggers

{% hint style="info" %}
Triggers require a [license](https://ironmansoftware.com/pricing/powershell-universal).
{% endhint %}

Triggers allow for automation jobs to be started when certain events happen within PowerShell Universal. For example, this allows you to take action when jobs complete, the server starts or dashboards stop. Triggers are useful for assigning global error handling or sending notifications when certain things happen.

{% hint style="info" %}
Triggered jobs will not cause additional triggers to start. Triggers are stored in the `triggers.ps1`.
{% endhint %}

## Trigger Events

The following types of events can be assigned a trigger.

* Job Started
* Job Completed
* Job Requesting Feedback
* Job Failed
* Dashboard Started
* Dashboard Stopped
* Server Started
* Server Stopping
* User Login
* Use of a Revoked App Token
* API Authentication Failed
* API Error
* New User Login
* Git Sync
* License Expired
* License Expiring

### New User Login

The user login event takes place when a user accesses PowerShell Universal. The script will receive a `$User`parameter with user information.

```powershell
@{
    Name = "username"
    Roles = @()
}
```

### User Login

The user login event takes place when a user accesses PowerShell Universal. The script will receive a `$data` parameter with user information. The data structure is shown below.

```powershell
@{
    UserName = 'username'
    RemoteIpAddress = ''
    LocalPort = ''
    RemotePort = ''
}
```

### Use of a Revoked App Token

The app token event takes place when a revoked app token is used. The script will receive a `$data` parameter that contains the contents of the app token as a string.

### Git Sync

This trigger occurs when a git sync is run. This trigger will fire for both successful and unsuccessful git syncs.

You will receive the following object in the `$data` parameter.

```csharp
public class GitStatus 
{
    public long Id { get; set; }
    public string CommitId { get; set; }
    public DateTime Timestamp { get; set; }
    public TimeSpan SyncTime { get; set; }
    public int Changes { get; set; }
    public string Location { get; set; }
    public string Remote { get; set; }
    public GitStatusResult Result { get; set; }
    public string ResultMessage { get; set; }
    public string ComputerName { get; set; }
}
```

## Global Triggers

Global triggers will start the assigned script whenever the event type is invoked.

For example, the `Script.ps1` will be run whenever any job is run.

```powershell
New-PSUTrigger -Name 'Trigger' -EventType JobStarted -TriggerScript Script.ps1
```

## Resource Triggers

Resource triggers will start the assigned script when the event takes place on the selected resource.

For example, the `Script.ps1` will be run whenever the `Dashboard` is stopped.

```powershell
New-PSUTrigger -Name 'Trigger' -EventType DashboardStopped -TriggerScript Script.ps1 -Dashboard 'Dashboard'
```

## Event Metadata

Whenever a job is started from a trigger, it will be provided with metadata about object that caused the event to trigger.

Triggers related to jobs will be provided a `$Job` parameter.

```powershell
param($Job)

$Job
```

Triggers related to dashboards will be provided a `$Dashboard` parameter.

```powershell
param($Dashboard)

$Dashboard
```

Triggers related to the server status will not receive a parameter.

## Conditions

Using the `-Condition` parameter of `New-PSUTrigger`, you can determine whether or not a trigger should be run based on local conditions on the server. Return `$true` or `$false` from the condition.

For example, you can disable a trigger if the `Environment` environment variable is not set to `production`.

```powershell
New-PSUTrigger -Condition {
   $Env:Environment -eq 'production'
}
```
