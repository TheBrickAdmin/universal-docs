# About

Apps are individual websites created with PowerShell Universal. They take advantage of a large set of pre-defined cmdlets for [all kinds of components](components/) and [interactive features](interaction.md). You can use apps to create dynamic websites that meet any need you can think of. Some common apps are:&#x20;

* Disparate Data Grouped into Tables and Data Grids
* End User Onboarding Tools
* UI Tools for System Management without Elevated Credentials

Apps should be considered an advanced feature and require both knowledge of the PowerShell Universal app cmdlets as well as a decent knowledge of PowerShell itself. With that said, they provide the greatest level of customization for web apps in PowerShell.
