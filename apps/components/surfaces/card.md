# Card

**Cards contain content and actions about a single subject.**

Cards are surfaces that display content and actions on a single topic. They should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information. Elements, like text and images, should be placed on them in a way that clearly indicates hierarchy.

## Simple Card

Although cards can support multiple actions, UI controls, and an overflow menu, use restraint and remember that cards are entry points to more complex and detailed information.

```powershell
New-UDCard -Title 'Simple Card' -Content {
    "This is some content"
}
```

## Advanced Card

You can use the body, header, footer and expand cmdlets to create advanced cards. The below example creates a card with various features based on a Hyper-V VM.

```powershell
$Header = New-UDCardHeader -Avatar (New-UDAvatar -Content { "R" } -Sx @{ backgroundColor = "#f44336" }) -Action (New-UDIconButton -Icon (New-UDIcon -Icon 'EllipsisVertical')) -Title 'Shrimp and Chorizo Paella' -SubHeader 'September 14, 2016';
$Media = New-UDCardMedia -Image 'https://mui.com/static/images/cards/paella.jpg'
$Body = New-UDCardBody -Content {
    New-UDTypography -Text ' This impressive paella is a perfect party dish and a fun meal to cook together with your guests. Add 1 cup of frozen peas along with the mussels, if you like.' -Sx @{
        color = 'text.secondary'
    } -Variant body2
}
$Footer = New-UDCardFooter -Content {
    New-UDIconButton -Icon (New-UDIcon -Icon 'Heart')
    New-UDIconButton -Icon (New-UDIcon -Icon 'ShareAlt')
}
$Expand = New-UDCardExpand -Content {
    $Description = @"
    Heat oil in a (14- to 16-inch) paella pan or a large, deep skillet over
    medium-high heat. Add chicken, shrimp and chorizo, and cook, stirring
    occasionally until lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer shrimp to a
    large plate and set aside, leaving chicken and chorizo in the pan. Add
    piment√≥n, bay leaves, garlic, tomatoes, onion, salt and pepper, and cook,
    stirring often until thickened and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Add
    saffron broth and remaining 4 1/2 cups chicken broth; bring to a boil.
    New-UDTypography -Text $Description
}
New-UDCard -Header $Header -Media $Media -Body $Body -Footer $Footer -Expand $Expand -Sx @{
    maxWidth = 345
    border   = '2px solid #f0f2f5'
}
```
