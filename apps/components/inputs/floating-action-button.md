# Floating Action Button

A floating action button (FAB) performs the primary, or most common, action on a screen.

A floating action button appears in front of all screen content, typically as a circular shape with an icon in its center. FABs come in two types: regular, and extended.

Only use a FAB if it is the most suitable way to present a screenâ€™s primary action.

Only one floating action button is recommended per screen to represent the most common action.
