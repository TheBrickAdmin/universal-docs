# Widgets

Widgets are user interfaces blocks built with PowerShell and Blazor. You can create robust web-based used interfaces with minimal web development experience.&#x20;

## Built In Widgets

PowerShell Universal includes many built in widgets that you can easily add to your portal pages. Each widget can be resized, positioned and have its properties customized.&#x20;

You can view a list of all the [built-in widgets here](https://ironmansoftware.com/powershell-universal/modules/widgets).&#x20;

## Custom Widgets

You can develop your own custom widgets using PSBlazor. PSBlazor employs Razor-like syntax combined with PowerShell to allow for creating fully interactive and customizable components.
