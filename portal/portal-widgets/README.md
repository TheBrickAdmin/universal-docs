# Portal Widgets

Widgets are user interfaces blocks built with PowerShell and Blazor. You can create robust web-based used interfaces with minimal web development experience.&#x20;

## Pre-built Widgets

You can find widgets created by Ironman Software and community members on the [PowerShell Universal Gallery](../../gallery.md).&#x20;

## Custom Widgets

You can develop your own custom widgets using PSBlazor. PSBlazor employs Razor-like syntax combined with PowerShell to allow for creating fully interactive and customizable components.
