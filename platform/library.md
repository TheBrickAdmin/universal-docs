# Gallery

The Gallery is a collection of pre-built solutions for PowerShell Universal. It includes resources such as scripts, triggers, apps, and widgets. It is open-source, and the modules are published to the PowerShell Gallery. The [PowerShell Universal Gallery](https://powershelluniversal.com/gallery) provides a filtered list of resources specific to the platform.

## Installing Resources from the Gallery

### Gallery Page

The Gallery page discovers PowerShell Universal modules in the PowerShell Gallery. It will cache the results for 5 minutes to improve performance.&#x20;

To install resources from the library, click Platform \ Gallery in the Universal Admin Console. Click the Install icon to save the resource into your environment. Each solution is a PowerShell module that will be included in your Repository's module directory.&#x20;

Resources installed from modules, like from the Gallery, are marked as read-only in the Admin Console.&#x20;

### Module Page

On the module page, click Galleries, and then select the PSGallery to search and download resources directly from the PowerShell Gallery feed. You will need to filter by the `PowerShellUniversal`tag to find modules specific to the platform.

## Uninstalling Resources

Once a resource is installed, you cannot remove it unless you remove the module itself. You can navigate to the Platform \ Modules page and click the Repository Modules tab to view modules installed from the library.&#x20;

Clicking the Delete icon will remove the module and any resources associated with it.&#x20;
