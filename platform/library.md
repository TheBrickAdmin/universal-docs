# Library

The Universal Library is a collection of pre-built solutions for PowerShell Universal. It includes resources such as scripts, triggers, apps, and widgets.&#x20;

The [library ](https://github.com/ironmansoftware/scripts/issues)is open-source, and each release of PowerShell Universal includes a copy that is downloaded during the build process. The library is registered as a PowerShell Module Repository in PowerShell Universal. It consists of a folder of `.nupkg` files for each module.&#x20;

## Installing and Updating the Library

Navigate to the Library page on Platform \ Library and click Install Library to install the latest version of the library. It will download a ZIP file from GitHub, extract it locally and register the folder as a PowerShell Module Repository.

## Installing Resources from the Library

To install resources from the library, click Platform \ Library in the Universal Admin Console. Click the Install icon to save the resource into your environment. Each solution is a PowerShell module that will be included in your Repository's module directory.&#x20;

Resources installed from modules, like from the Library, are marked as read-only in the Admin Console.&#x20;

## Uninstalling Resources

Once a resource is installed, you cannot remove it unless you remove the module itself. You can navigate to the Platform \ Modules page and click the Repository Modules tab to view modules installed from the library.&#x20;

Clicking the Delete icon will remove the module and any resources associated with it.&#x20;
