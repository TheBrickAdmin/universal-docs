# Local Accounts

## Local Accounts

Local accounts are created and stored in the PowerShell Universal database. By default, credentials are stored in the local database vault.

To create a local account, you can navigate to Security \ Identities and create a new identity. Ensure that the Local Account switch is enabled and set a password.

If you have a licensed instance of PowerShell Universal, you can use a different credential vault.

## Password Restrictions

Passwords are required to be of at least 12 characters long and require a letter, number and symbol. Passwords will expire after 90 days. Users can reset their passwords at any time in the admin console or portal.&#x20;
