# Local Accounts

## Local Accounts

Local accounts are created and stored in the PowerShell Universal database. By default, credentials are stored in the local database vault.

To create a local account, you can navigate to Security \ Identities and create a new identity. Ensure that the Local Account switch is enabled and set a password.

If you have a licensed instance of PowerShell Universal, you can use a different credential vault.
