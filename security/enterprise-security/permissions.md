description: Permissions for resources within PowerShell Universal

# Permissions

PowerShell Universal leverages permissions throughout the platform to provide fine-grained authorization against different scopes and resources. Built-in roles have a read-only set of permissions that are automatically applied to users with those roles. Custom roles can have custom permissions set. Additionally, individual users can have their own set of permissions.&#x20;

Permissions are stored in the database and not as part of the `.universal` configuration files.&#x20;

### Permission Identifiers

Each permission uses an identifier to authorize a user to access a resource. They are strings that utilize the scope and resource type, followed by an access type.&#x20;

For example, the following would provide read access to all API features.&#x20;

```
apis\read
```

Wildcards can be used in permission identifiers to include sub-scopes over multiple access types. The following provides access to all script features.&#x20;

```
automation.scripts\*
```

### Managing Permissions

{% hint style="warning" %}
PowerShell Universal v5 is still in beta and this is subject to change.
{% endhint %}

Permissions can be managed for an identity by click Security \ Permissions. You can select the identity and define a permission identifier to grant to the identity. This will blend with the permissions granted by any role assignments they may have.&#x20;

Roles currently cannot be assigned permissions.
